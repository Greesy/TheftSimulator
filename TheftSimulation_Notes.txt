Python city theft simulator notes:

Statistics
    -City of Chicago
        -Got info from 2010 to present
            -Only looking at residential/apartment theft

Objects
    -Household objects
        -Have an attractiveness value
            -Determines how appealing that house is to a thief
            -Determines possible takeaway for the thief (monetary)
        -Have a security value
            -Determines likelihood of being caught robbing this house
            -
    -Distric objects?
        -Have their own attractiveness and security values that may apply to all locations inside by default?
    -Police objects
        -Signify either a patrolling or parked car
        -Automatically lower attractiveness and/or increase security of nearby locations
            -Maybe attractiveness only lowers if thieves see the cop car, but security goes up regardless
    -Thief objects
        -Maybe have a percieved attractiveness modifier for each location?
        -Utilize utility function to compare attractiveness and likelihood of being caught to determine whether or not to rob a house
            -Each thief could have a utility threshold, so they do not rob a place unless the utility is above that threshold
            -Each thief should probably have a predetermined level of risk aversion

Attractiveness




Utility function
    -Needs to relate jail time to monetary value on a singular scale i.e. how much of a potential payoff is required to risk a certain amount of jail time

    -Possible functions
        -Isoelastic     n > 0 for risk aversion
            {(c^(1-n)-1)/1-n    n != 1 }
            {ln(c)              n == 1 }
        -Exponential    a > 0 for risk aversion
            {(1-e^(-ac))/a      a != 0 }
            {c                  a == 0 }
